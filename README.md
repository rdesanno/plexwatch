Plex Watch workflow for Alfred

I travel often enough to have two separate links to watch Plex; one to stream from Plex.tv and the other over my local network. This workflow will determine if I am at at home or not, and choose the appropriate URL to stream from.

After the proper variables are set, just type in "plex" and enjoy.
